# Personalized Email Sender

A simple Node.js script that reads recipient data from a JSON file and sends personalized emails using Nodemailer.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your machine.
- A Gmail account with an [App Password](https://myaccount.google.com/security-checkup) for secure authentication.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd your-repo
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with your Gmail credentials:

   ```env
   EMAIL="your-email@gmail.com"
   PASSWORD="your-app-password"
   ```

   Replace `"your-email@gmail.com"` with your Gmail address and `"your-app-password"` with the [App Password](https://myaccount.google.com/security-checkup) you generated.

5. Update the `email.json` file with your recipient data:

   ```json
   [
       {
           "name": "Test Person 1",
           "email": "test.person1@example.com",
           "msg": "Hello World!"
       },
       // Add more recipients as needed
   ]
   ```

6. Run the script:

   ```bash
   node sendEmail.js
   ```

   The script will send personalized emails to each recipient in the `email.json` file.

## Notes

- Ensure that your Gmail account allows access to "Less secure apps." You can enable this in your [Google Account settings](https://myaccount.google.com/security-checkup).
- Keep your `.env` file secure and do not share it or commit it to version control.

Feel free to customize the script and adapt it to your specific use case!
